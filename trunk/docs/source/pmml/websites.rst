PMML Websites
=============

Some very good websites have PMML models and input data sets
that can be utilized to test Kamanja.
The Data Mining Group web site page
(http://dmg.org/pmml/pmml_examples/index.html) uses some of them.
Below is a list of data sources.
It should be noted that to achieve optimum throughput,
especially on a multi-node Kamanja cluster,
the data needs to have a partition key specified in its message definition.
