CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a simple data format
that includes a series of fields of data,
separated by a comma.
It is one of the simplest forms of data to use
and data from most data storage formats
can easily be converted to CSV format.
CSV is often used as an intermediate format
for converting data from one data storage format to another
and can also be an easy format to use
when testing data analysis code.

Kamanja supports CSV as an input, output, and storage format.
