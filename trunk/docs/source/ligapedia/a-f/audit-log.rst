Audit logging
-------------

Kamanja audit logging captures each metadata operation
that is attempted on the cluster, such as CRUD operations on metadata objects.
For example, for each user action, auditing records who attempted the action,
when the action was attempted, and whether or not the operation succeeded.
REST APIs are provided to access the audit information.
