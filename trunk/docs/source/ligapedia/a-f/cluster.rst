Cluster (Kamanja)
-----------------

In a Kamanja environment,
a cluster is a group of one or more Kamanja :ref:`nodes<node-term>`
that work together on the same task;
typically, clusters do not overlap.
Kamanja scales horizontally;
to increase the capacity of the environment,
add additional clusters.

For more information:

- Each :ref:`clusterconfig-config-ref` file
  is identified by a ClusterId and contains
  configuration for a cluster in the environment.
- Use the :ref:`clusterinstallerdriver-command-ref` command
  to install a cluster.
