AVRO
----

Apach AVRO is a popular data
:ref:`serialization<serial-deserial-term>` system
that specifies its format with AVRO schemas
instead of inline type tags.
Its capabilities include rich data structures
(maps, arrays, and a compact binary data format
that plays well in clustered (multi-machine) environments
such as Kamanja).

Kamanja does not currently support AVRO.
