Caching
-------

The Kamanja engine uses caching to improve performance on the cluster.
Applications and models have limited access
to the engine's caching capabilities,
with the ability to cache specified containers to memory
to reduce I/O bottlenecks.
Other caching capabilities required by the application
must be coded as part of the application.
