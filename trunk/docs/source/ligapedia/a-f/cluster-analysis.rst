Cluster analysis
----------------

When discussing data mining algorithms,
a cluster analysis is a type of
:ref:`unsupervised learning<unsupervised-learning-term>`
that groups records with similar attributes or fields.
A cluster center is the average over the records for that cluster,
for each field used to define the cluster.
For example, if the data was the X, Y position of points on a barn door,
and a shotgun had been fired three times at the barn door
a cluster analysis should group the pellets
from each of the the three shots as a different cluster
(depending on the amount of overlap).
