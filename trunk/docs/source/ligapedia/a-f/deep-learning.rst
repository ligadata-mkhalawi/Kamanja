Deep Learning
-------------

Deep Learning is a branch of :ref:`machine learning<machine-learning-term>`
that runs sophisticated algorithms on large amounts of information
to identify characteristics and relationships in that data
that were not previously known.
Most Deep Learning uses algorithms called
:ref:`neural networks<neural-networks-term>`,
which typically consist of multiple layers
that attempt to emulate the way the brain works.
The neural networks that run on current technology are far less complex
than actual human brains but can do more complicated analyses
than other algorithms.
Most commonly, neural networks are used
for :ref:`unsupervised learning<unsupervised-learning-term>` tasks
where the computer chooses the features
(or data fields) to be analyzed to do text, image, or music analysis.
This contrasts with :ref:supervised learning<supervised-learning-term>,
where the analyst tags the information to be considered.
