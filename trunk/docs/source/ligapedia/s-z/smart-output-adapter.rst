Smart output file adapter
-------------------------

A smart file output adapter (also known as a smart file producer)
is an output adapter that can persist Kamanja results
to an HDFS or local file system.
This adapter supports compression and can produce files
in gzip, bzip2, or xz compression format.
The results can be partitioned into different files and folders
using time partition data and partition keys.

  that control how the smart output file adapter works.
