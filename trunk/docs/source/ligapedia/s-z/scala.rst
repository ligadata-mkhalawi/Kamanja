Scala
-----

Scala (Scalable Language)
is a general-purpose programming language
that runs on a JVM and has complete language interoperability with Java.
Scala is fully supported for application development on Kamanja.
Models written in Scala are multi-threaded
and so give better performance than the other options.
Scala includes a number of other features
that make up for deficiencies in Java.
Like Java, it is most appropriate for simple, rule-based models.

Fields from a :ref:`message<messages-term>` definition,
(which must be written in JSON)
can be converted to into Scala class members and processed as such.

For more information:

- :ref:`scala-install`
- :ref:`scala-models-top` gives information
  about developing Scala applications on Kamanja
  with examples.
