Monit
-----

Monit is an open source utility that can be used
to manage and monitor processes, programs, files, and so forth.
It can be configured on Kamaja releases 1.6.3 and later
to monitor the status of the Kamanja cluster
and each Kamanja and non-Kamanja node that is configured
and, when necessary, restart any node that has failed.

For more information:

- :ref:`monit-admin` discusses how to use Monit to monitor
  a Kamanja cluster.
- :ref:`monitrc-config-ref` documents the default monit configuration file
  that is supplied with Kamanja.
