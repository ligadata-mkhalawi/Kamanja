Messages, fixed
---------------


:ref:`Message definitions<message-def-config-ref>`
can be fixed or :ref:`mapped<messages-mapped-term>`.
Use fixed messages when all fields are available
in the incoming data stream and they are presented to the model;
they are represented as a Scala class instance at runtime.
