Queue
-----

In Kafka and Kamanja, a queue is the same thing as a :ref:`topic<topic-term>`.
In some messaging systems, queues and topics function differently
but the Kafka implementation of topics encapsules
both sets of functionality.

See `Kafka as a Messaging System
<https://kafka.apache.org/intro#kafka_mq>`_
for more information about Kafka topics
and how they incorporate the functionality
that is ascribed to queues in other messaging systems.
