R is an open source language and environment
for machine learning, statistical computing, and graphics.

You can run a trained R model on the Kamanja cluster
by exporting the model to :ref:`PMML<pmml-term>`
and then configure that model to run on the Kamanja cluster.

For more information:

- :ref:`pmml-guide-top` gives instructions for configuring
  a PMML application on Kamanja.
