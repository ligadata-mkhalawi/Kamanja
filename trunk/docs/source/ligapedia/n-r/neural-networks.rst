Neural networks
---------------

Neural networks are a set of algorithms used primarily
for :ref:`deep learning<deep-learning-term>`.
They attempt to mimic the complex calculations of the brain and,
while the neural networks that run on current technology
are far less complex than actual human brains,
they can do more complicated analyses than other algorithms.

Neural networks capitalize on the power of modern machines
to provide multidimensional computing for unsupervised learning,
where the computer analyzes the data to detect patterns;
they are widely used for text, image, and music analysis.
This unsupervised le arning can be combined
with more traditional supervised learning algorithms
and statistical learning to extract useful information
from a large body of text such as a database of emails
that are sent and received.
