Introduction
============

Models are programming constructs written in Python, R, Java, Scala, PMML, etc.
to control the input ingestion, make decisions,
and produce output for different use-cases.
Multiple models can be chained into a pipeline,
configured and deployed on a Kamanja cluster.
Models in the pipeline pass data using messages;
the output message of one model
becomes an input message for the next model in the pipeline.
Kamanja is compatible with many modeling language standards
and can consume many different types of data.

The Kamanja platform enables you to create, run,
and continuously enhance multiple models
that are applied to each new data event that enters the decision layer:

- Models can be developed using a variety of languages, libraries, and IDEâ€™s.
  You can use Kamanja as the platform to develop a model
  or you can import a trained model to Kamanja from some other platform.

- Models can range from simple rules-based decision trees written in Java
  to sophisticated non-linear classifiers implemented in Python, Java, or Scala.

- Models can continuously leverage the most recent and all past data
  to make arbitrarily complex decisions at any given moment.

- By adding nodes, Kamanja scales to meet
  virtually any volume of data or number and complexity of models.

- The output of one model run can be exported
  and then used as input to another model run;
  this means that applications can be modularized
  into a number of discrete models
  that run in a pre-defined order as a pipeline.

.. note:: In the world of machine learning and data mining,
          the term model usually refers only to the code
          that executes an analytical algorithm;
          it may also have code that preprocesses data
          and performs feature engineering.

          Kamanja uses the term "model" to refer to any programatic code
          used in the pipeline
