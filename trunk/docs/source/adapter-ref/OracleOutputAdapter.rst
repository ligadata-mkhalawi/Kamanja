Oracle Output Adapter
=====================

The Oracle Output Adapter is a "ref:`smart-output-config-ref`
that feeds the data to an Oracle database.

Parameters
----------

The first few parameters are the standard ones
used for all adapters and described on the
:ref:`adapter-def-config-ref` page.
Note the following:

- **ClassName** - Implementation class of output adapter interface for oracle
- **JarName** - Name of the jar that contains the implementation class
- **DependencyJars** - Include Oracle thin jdbc driver


In addition, the **AdapterSpecificCfg** parameter
has the following attributes:

- **hostname** - URL of the host machine
  where the Oracle instance is running.
- **instancename** - Name of the Oracle instance.
- **portnumber** - Oracle listener port number.
  Use the `tnspring <http://www.orafaq.com/wiki/Tnsping>`_ command
  to show the port number
- **user**, **password** - user name and password used
  to connect to the Oracle database
  if you do not use the encrypted/encoded password feature.
- **Encrypted.Encoded.Password** - Password generated by
  :ref:`generatekeys-command-ref` to implement
  :ref:`encrypted and encoded passwords<password-encrypt-term>`.
  To implement this feature in your application,
  you must populate this parameter and the next one
  for the smart input adapter you are using.
- **PrivateKeyFile** - private.key file to use for your application.
  You can use :ref:`generatekeys-command-ref` to create this file
  for testing.
- **SchemaName** - name of the Oracle schema to which the data is being output.
- **jarpaths** - full pathname of the directory that contains
  the Oracle jdbc driver jar file.
- **jdbcJar** - name of the Oracle jdbc thin driver file
- **autoCreateTables** - set to NO to prevent Kamanja from creating tables
- **appendOnly** - set to YES if new data is just appended to existing data;
  set to NO  if duplicates can not be allowed (expensive)


Usage
-----

The names and types specified
in the :ref:`message definition<message-def-config-ref>`
must match what is defined in the Oracle schema
identified by the **SchemaName** parameter,
with the following caveats:

- All Kamanja decimal types are mapped to NUMBER type in Oracle.
- A Kamanja Boolean type is mapped to varchar2(5)
  because Kamanja ouputs a Boolean value as "true" or "false"
- A String type is mapped to varchar2(100)
  because, while the Kamanja :ref:`message definition<message-def-config-ref>`
  does not limit the size of the string,
  the Oracle VARCHAR2 type requires a size when a table is being created.

Note the following limitations:

- Only Basic :ref:`Types<types-term>` are supported;
  this includes Integer, double, Float, String, and Boolean
- The tableName in oracle is restricted to 30 characters,
  so all API functions should use a plain className
  (without the package name)
