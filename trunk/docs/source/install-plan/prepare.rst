===============

Before beginning your Kamanja installation:

- Install either a supported operating system
  or Hadoop stack; see :ref:`platform-reqs`.
- Ensure that you have adequate hardware;
  see :ref:`hardware-reqs`.
- If you are installing a multi-node cluster,
  configure networking between all nodes.
