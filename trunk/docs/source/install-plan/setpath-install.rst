Run SetPaths.sh (single-node only)
----------------------------------

If you are installing a single-node cluster,
run :ref:`setpaths-command-ref`
to set all the paths to the current installed location of Kamanja:

::

    cd $KAMANJA_HOME/bin
    SetPaths.sh $KAFKA_HOME

When this has run successfully,
your single-node cluster is installed and ready to use.

You can start your cluster
following the instructions in :ref:`start-stop-cluster`.
