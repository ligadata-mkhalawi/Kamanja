Planning your Kamanja environment
=================================

A Kamanja environment contains one or more
:ref:`clusters<cluster-term>`,
each of which contains one or more :ref:`nodes<node-term>`.
A node is a single server or VM.
The following installation scenarios are supported:

- :ref:`Install a single-node cluster<kamanja-install-top>`.
  This is appropriate for development, unit-testing,
  and demonstration purposes.

- :ref:`Install developer tools<develop-install-top>`
  if you will be developing software on this system.

- Configure a multi-node cluster
  for systems that will be used for production.

- :ref:`Upgrade<upgrade-install-top>` from an earlier version
  of Kamanja.

.. _platform-reqs:

Platform requirements
---------------------

- Linux OS: Redhat, CentOS
- MAC OS: 10.9 and later

Kamanja has also been tested on the following Hadoop stacks:

- Cloudera
- HortonWorks 2.5.3
