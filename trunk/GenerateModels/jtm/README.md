# Json transformation models (jtm)

## JTM format

### Conventions

List: array of values 
    name: ["value1", "value2", ..., "valueN"]

Map: and object with key value pairs. Value can be string or objects 

```javascript
    name : {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2",
        "keyN": "valueN"        
    }

    name : {
        "key1": {...},
        "key2": {...},
        "keyN": {...}        
    }
```

References

    If an expression needs to reference an external element it need to be marked with a $element

    $element or ${element} - references something in the current name space like a alias or a generated variable. There referenced element must be unique
    ${alias.element} - references something in the current alias name space

    Mapper messages always need to be in the form of ${alias.element}

    References to messages must be lower case as names are
    
    System variables
    
    context as JtmContext - it gives access to the current error state during process. use $context to reference the variable. Context becomes a part of the input namespace and must be disambiguated if it occurs as part of a message

### The 5 main sections

Header - specifies the "target" language, version and the namespace. Those three elements are used during the code generation. There is also a version attribute, add missing Requirements

```javascript
  "header": {
    "namespace": "com.ligadata.jtm.test.filter",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "language": "scala",
    "minVersion": "2.11",
    "description": "Add a short description here"
    "name": "className"
  }
``
Imports - specify  additional packages/libraries to be used, in addition you can also add code to be added to the model. Code provide in that way can conflict with internal names and variables.

You can also specify code to be added in  package, factory and model.

```javascript
  "imports": {
    "packages": [ "com.ligadata.Utils._", "com.ligadata.runtime._" ],

  "packagecode": [
    "code line 1",
    "code line 2",
    "...",
    "code line N"
  ], 
  "factorycode": [
    "code line 1",
    "code line 2",
    "...",
    "code line N"
   ], 
   "modelcode": [
    "code line 1",
    "code line 2",
     "...",
    "code line N"
   ]
```

Grok - specifies the grok instances that can be used later in the transformations. Current limit is 1.

```javascript
  "grok": {
      "name_grok_instance" : {
        "builtInDictionary": true,
        "match": "{EMAIL: email}",
        "file": ["path"],
        "patterns_dis": {
          "DOMAINTLD": "[a-zA-Z]+",
          "EMAIL": "%{NOTSPACE}@%{WORD}\\.%{DOMAINTLD}"
        }
      }
  }
```

Aliases - specify aliases for long type names to be used in the transformation section, reference to what messages, concepts and variables are.

```javascript
  "aliases": {
    "messages": {
      "mm1": "com.ligadata.kamanja.test.msg5",
      "mo1": "com.ligadata.kamanja.test.msg2"
    },
    "concepts": {
       "cm1": "com.ligadata.kamanja.test.msg5",
       "co1": "com.ligadata.kamanja.test.msg2"
    },
    "variables": {
       "cm1": "com.ligadata.kamanja.test.msg5",
       "co1": "com.ligadata.kamanja.test.msg2"
    }
  }
```

Transformations

    Transformations section sepcifies induvidual named transformations. Each transformation can contain multiple outputs.

    DependsOn specifies set of messages that are require before a transformation can fire
    
    Computes: list with computations
    
    Outputs: specifies the ouputs the transformation section can produce. It can contain a mapping and computes list and a single where condition
        
        Mapping map - key output target, value can contain a variable or expression

        mapbyposition - Bulk assignments of array elements to variables or expression, fields with '-" are ignored
        
        Where value if the expression evaluates to true processing will continue
        
        Computes: map with computations
    
        "grok matches": map with grok matches, left side of a match has to valid according to https://github.com/aicer/grok. The syntax for a grok pattern is %{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC}. Everything with a sematic can be assigned to variable. 

```javascript
    "transformations": {
        "test1": {
          "dependsOn": [ ["m1"],  ["m2"]],
          "computes": {
            "out3":{ "type": "Int", "vals": ["$m1.in1 + 1000", "$m2.in1 + 2000"], "comment": "in scala, type could be optional" }
          },
    
          "grok match": {
            "in1": "%{EMAIL:email} %{DOMAIN:domain} %{USER:user}"
          },
          
          "outputs": {
            "o1": {
              "mapbyposition": { "arrayfield": [ "in2", "-"] },
              "mapping": {
                "out1": "in1",
                "out2": "t1",
                "out4": "in3"
              },
    
              "where": "!($in2 != -1 && $in2 < 100)",
    
              "computes": {
                "t1": { "type": "String", "val": "\"s:\" + ($in2).toString()" }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
```
    Comment and Comments:
    
    The forllowing sections support comments - compute object, transformation object

```javascript    
    { comment: "single line comment" }
    { comments: ["multiple", "lines", "comment"] }
```

### Deep-dive transformation section 

## Logging

The model has 5 logging methods with 3 overloads each. The tracing can be configured through log4j.

Functions: Trace, Warning, Info, Error, Debug
Overloads: <Function>(str: String), <Function>(str: String, e: Throwable) AND <Function>(e: Throwable)


===================== Other =============================
jtm structure:
        1. grok match - common grok match expressions across all transformations
        2. computes - common computed values used by all transformations
        3. each named transformation contains the following
            a. dependsOn - an array of sets; where this named transformation triggers when one of the sets satisfy
               each set can contain messages or concepts or variables or combination of them.
            b. grok match - matching section that can contain one or more grok pattern match expressions
            c. computes - transformation level computed values; these could be shared across all outputs
            d. outputs - zero or more output definitions

Allows to specify transformation in a json file that is translated to scala code and is executed as a model
